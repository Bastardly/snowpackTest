# New Project

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

## Available Scripts

### npm run build

I reverted this example, so that it resembles the official templates. I just added some loosely configured TypeScript, and a tiny Lit-Html app on top of it.

Builds the app for "production" to the `build/` folder.
